# Car Evaluation Dataset - Performance Comparison of Hyperparameter Optimization Techniques


The following notebook explores the performance of various hyperparameter optimization techniques, including our custom Plumber Optimizer, on the Car Evaluation Dataset for imbalanced multiclass classification using the weighted F1-score as the evaluation metric. The dataset features include buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, passenger capacity, luggage boot size, and safety, with the target being car acceptability. Plumber Optimizer is compared against traditional methods such as Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization (BayesSearchCV). Metrics like execution time, memory usage, CPU usage, and validation F1-score are collected for evaluation and comparison. The Plumber Optimizer demonstrated competitive F1-scores with efficient resource utilization, achieving a mean F1-score of 0.9663 while maintaining lower execution times. Thus, we have shown the Plumber Optimizerâ€™s effectiveness in hyperparameter tuning, offering a balance of accuracy, efficiency, and resource usage. Detailed results, including metrics and comparisons, are provided in the notebook.
